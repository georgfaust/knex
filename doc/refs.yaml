  the array can be reset to no elements by writing zero on element 0 
  [3/4/1:4.3.1.3]

III: |
  The array shall automatically be extended if an element is written beyond the currently last element, 
  but within the maximum allowed number of entries.

IV: |
  If the remote application process receives an A_PropertyValue_Read-PDU with start_index = 0, this is,
  reading the current number of elements of the Property Value array, but with a nr_of_elem greater than 1,
  then it shall respond with an A_PropertyValue_Response-PDU with start_index = 0 and nr_of_elem = 1
  and the field data shall contain the current number of elements of the Property array. [3/3/7:3.4.3.1]

V: |
  TODO - If the remote application process has a problem, e.g. object or
  Property does not exist or the data does not fit in a PDU or the requester has not the required access
  rights, then the nr_of_elem of the A_PropertyValue_Response-PDU shall be zero and shall contain no
  data.

  TODO - If the property_id ... is zero, ... use the indicated property_index to access the Property description. 
  The property_index in the A_PropertyDescription_Response-PDU shall be the value of the field property_index 
  of the received A_PropertyDescription_Read-PDU. 
  [3/3/7:3.4.3.3]

VII: |
  If the property_id in the A_PropertyDescription_Read-PDU is not zero, then the field property_index
  shall be ignored; the remote application process shall use the indicated property_id to access the Property
  description. The property_index in the A_PropertyDescription_Response-PDU shall in this case be ...
  the correct value of the Property index of the addressed Property.
