  If the remote application process receives an A_PropertyValue_Read-PDU with start_index = 0, this is,
  reading the current number of elements of the Property Value array, but with a nr_of_elem greater than 1,
  then it shall respond with an A_PropertyValue_Response-PDU with start_index = 0 and nr_of_elem = 1

  If the property_id in the A_PropertyDescription_Read-PDU is not zero, then the field property_index

  not_ok), the local Application Layer shall pass an A_IndividualAddress_Write.Lcon (a_status = not_ok)
  to the local user indicating that the transmission of the associated T_Data_Broadcast.req did not succeed.

  If the Load State of the related Resource changes to ‘unloaded’ then the Management Server shall set the

  is not successful then the value shall be set to zero.
